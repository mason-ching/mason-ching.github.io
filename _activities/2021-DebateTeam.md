            I served as the <em>fourth debater</em> in the debate team of School of Mathematics and Statistics. As the closing speaker, I was responsible for delivering final rebuttals, synthesizing arguments, and constructing impactful conclusions. In addition to competing, I took on a mentoring role, helping train recruits by organizing internal workshops and preparing research materials for incoming debaters.
