    This invention proposes a multi-modal data integration method based on convolutional sparse coding and optimal transport. We utilize convolutional sparse coding to collaboratively learn the latent representations of two multi-modal features, thereby addressing the interpretability issues commonly associated with neural networks. To better capture the data distribution when generating the latent space, optimal transport theory is employed to mitigate the issue of non-overlapping between the real and generated distributions. Furthermore, alignment is performed based on the correlation matrix between the multi-modal data, and the aligned point pairs are used to fuse the latent spaces of the two modalities, ultimately achieving effective multi-modal data integration. This invention significantly improves the classification accuracy in the integrated latent space and is appropriate for multi-omics integration tasks in the biomedical field, such as single-cell sequencing data and medical imaging data analysis.
