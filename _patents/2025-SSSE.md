        In the invention, we present an intelligent gangue recognition method based on the selective state space modeling, implemented within a lightweight deep learning network. Specifically, the proposed method is composed of a selective state space backbone, SimSPPF module, a multi-scale feature fusion layer, and a decoupled detection head. The state space backbone and SimSPPF module are jointly designed to extract both spatial and semantic information more effectively, thereby enhancing detection precision and robustness. The overall framework enables real-time gangue detection and localization across both still images and video streams, providing comprehensive information such as position and size of coals and gangues. This invention offers strong support for the efficient utilization of coal resources, and is particularly suited for deployment in low-resource or mobile computing environments.
