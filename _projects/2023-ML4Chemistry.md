        This project is the beginning of my research journey. I was fortunate to collaborate with Yanhui Guo and Prof. Xiaohui Yang in modeling organic chemical synthesis reactions using statistical and machine learning tools. In the two papers I contributed to, we utilized topological data analysis, ensemble learning (tree-based models), convolutional neural networks and multi-scale attention to build an intelligent system for yield analysis and prediction of organic synthesis. Our work aims to support researchers with comprehensive, multi-perspective decision-making information.
