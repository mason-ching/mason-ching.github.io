            Stomata play a critical role in regulating key physiological processes in plants, particularly for monitoring dynamic changes in living tissues under environmental perturbations. However, accurate high-throughput phenotyping remains bottleneck, as traditional methods rely on destructive sampling and labor-intensive annotations, limiting large-scale and field applications. To solve these challenges, we specially design an oriented detection network for analyzing small, dense, and cluttered stomata in nondestructive images and complex environments. Additionally, a diffusion-based restoration model is introduced to recover blurred images and improve detection accuracy. Restoration and detection are integrated into \(\mathrm{StomaD^2}\), a user-friendly and easy-to-operate all-in-one system that supports nondestructive, in-field stomatal imaging and enables real-time dynamic analysis of stomatal phenotypes (density, conductance, etc.). \(\mathrm{StomaD^2}\) is compatible with both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species, destructive and nondestructive images of crop stomata. Experiments show that \(\mathrm{StomaD^2}\) achieves expert-level accuracy, and its generalizability has been validated across diverse plant types, highlighting its potential for large-scale phenotyping, plant physiology research, and precision agriculture.
