# Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify; width: 100%;">
    Organic synthesis plays a vital role in optimizing existing drugs and innovating new drugs. As a significant and challenging research frontier in the field of organic synthesis, cross-coupling reactions have also attracted considerable attention. In the past few years, machine learning has realized great potential in predicting the performance of cross-coupling reactions. However, most of the existing machine learning methods are based on the two-dimensional feature information of the cross-coupling reactions. In order to obtain the coupling reaction features in a multifaceted way, we first explore the three-dimensional and topological descriptors of cross-coupling reactions based on the molecular stick-and-ball model and persistent homology analysis. On this basis, a weighted light convolutional neural network with multi-scale subtraction (OS-MSW) is proposed to extract the deep abstract features of the input descriptors, and the extracted features are applied to LightGBM for yield prediction, thus constructing a highly efficient prediction system, OS-MSWGBM. The experiments demonstrate that OS-MSWGBM exhibits higher efficiency and more accurate prediction results, as well as notably stable prediction performance, which can provide reliable decision-making information for experimental personnel or organizations.

# Highlights

* **Integrate complex representation** (3D geometry & topology) based on the molecular stick-and-ball model and persistent homology analysis.
* **Accelerate prediction** by constructing an hybrid and efficient yield prediction model.
* **Feature descriptor attribution** via gradient and eigenmatrix weighting.

# Method

## 1. Topological and 3D Geometric Descriptors

### 3D Geometric Descriptor

  <p><em>Figure 1. 2D structure formulas and corresponding 3D stick-and-ball models of some reactants.</em></p>
</div>

We compute the **spatial and physicochemical descriptors** using RDKit and Chem3D, including:

* **Molecular Surface Area (MSA)** and **Molecular Volume (MV)** via convex hull algorithms.
* **Polar Surface Area (PSA)** capturing polar atom contributions.
* **Moments of Inertia** reflecting mass distribution in 3D.
* **Principal Axes Lengths** and **Radius of Gyration** for shape quantification.
* **Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)** for interaction with solvents.

These descriptors enrich the feature space beyond classical 2D fingerprints, quantify the spatial structural and physicochemical properties of compounds.

### Topological Descriptors

We identify and analyze the **topological invariants** based on persistent homology, such as average lifetimes and persistent entropy of connected components, cycle structures, and void structures.

## 2. Hybrid OS-MSWGBM Network
OS-MSWGBM takes 2D, 3D and topological descriptors as the inputs, learns the deep multi-scale features of them, and finally uses LightGBM to predict yield.

### Multi-Scale Subtraction Weighting (OS-MSW)

* **Subtraction Unit**. Computes differences between feature maps:

  $$ M^{l}_{i+1} = Conv(|M^{l+1}_i - M^{l}_i|),$$

  where $$M^{l}_{i+1}$$ captures complementary differences across scales and provides richer information for the decoder.

* **Weighted Fusion**. Learn weights $$w_i$$ via sigmoid-activated pooling:

  $$C_{fused} = \sum_{i=1}^L w_i*C_{i}, \quad w_i = Sigmoid(LinearLayer(\mathrm{pool}(C_{i}))).$$

### Combine OS-MSW with LightGBM
* **LightGBM Prediction**. Optimize the objective function:

  $$\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i} l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \Omega(f),$$

  where $$l$$ is loss function (e.g., squared error), and $$\Omega$$ regularizes tree complexity.

## 3. Feature Descriptor Attribution

To trace how descriptors contribute to the final prediction, we adopt a gradient weighting technique:

* **Gradient Computation**.
   Calculate the gradient $$\nabla_x f$$ of the output $$f$$ with respect to the input $$x$$.

* **Weighted Contribution**.
   Multiply the gradient with the input's feature map block $$A$$:

   $$
   \alpha_i = \sum_{j,k} \nabla_{A_{j,k}} f * A_{i,j,k}
   $$

   where $$A_{i,j,k}$$ is the value of the $$i$$-th channel at location $$(j,k)$$ in feature map $$A$$.

* **Normalization**.
   Normalize $$\alpha_i$$ to get per-channel weights:

   $$
   w_i = \frac{\alpha_i}{\sum_i \alpha_i}
   $$

* **Final Attribution**.
   Multiply attribution weights with original inputs to get descriptor-level contribution:

   $$
   L_{\text{grad-CAM}}(x)_c = \sum_i w_i \cdot x_i
   $$
